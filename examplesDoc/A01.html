<h1>Variant Subsystem (simple)</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
This example shows, how to specify and manage a set of alternative system variants using an SES and the SES Toolbox API. Moreover, it shows how to generate automatically executable Simulink models based on an SES and Simulink's predefined blocksets.
The basic problem statement of this example is taken from the Simulink examples documentation, where you can find further information about it.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Basically the SES in this example describes 2 model variants, each  with: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li> 3 signal input generators,</li> 
	<li> a linear OR a non-linear controller and</li> 
	<li> a scope for visualizing</li> 
</ul>
<p>
The above version including a scope is defined in the SES <code>VarSubSysSES_v1.mat</code>.<br> 
If one wants to get evaluable output of the model after simulation the scope needs to be replaced with a Simulink Out block <code>VarSubSysSES_v2.mat</code>.
	
<h3>SES</h3>
<p>
In the SES the two controllers are modelled with the Specialization "ControllerSpec", where each alternative controller is decomposed into specific entities. The selection of a specific controller when pruning is defined by the SES Variable "VSS_MODE". The 3 structural identical signal input generators (sine wave generators) are specified using a MultiAspect, where the number of replications is set to the constant value of 3.
</p>

<h3>Multisets</h3>
<p>
The 3 signal input generators (sine wave generators) are all represented by the entity node Sine in the SES. However, the sine wave generators should be configured with different attribute values, such as different amplitudes or frequencies. This can be performed by using Multisets, which are defined with #{...}, such as Amplitude=#{0.1,2,0.3}. Here, the first sine wave generator will be configured with Amplitude=0.1, the second with Amplitude=2 and the third with Amplitude=0.3. 
</p>

<h3>Model Base</h3>
<p>
For generating an executable model, the general SES/MB approach is used.
As model base (MB), where the dynamic models are defined, we use the 
default Simulink blockset library.
</p>

<h3>Connection Between SES and MB</h3>
<p>
The leaf entities in the SES represent and reference specific dynamic models from a MB.
For example the entity "Scope" references the Scope block of the Simulink library.
In order to define a connection between the SES leaf entities and the dynamic models
from the MB, we use the special attribute "mb". At each leaf entity you can find the definition of the "mb" attribute with a specific string value that refers to an appropriate dynamic model. These references will be evaluated during model generation.
</p>

<h3>Model Generation and Execution</h3>
<p>
The model generation is invoked by a MATLAB function ./startFcn..., defined in the example's directory, which then calls the appropriate experiment function
located in the example's subdirectory "private" (./private/ experiment...).
The experiment function uses the SES toolbox API for pruning and flattening the SES depending on currrent settings of SES variables, calls the <i>Model Builder</i>, and finally the <i>Execution Unit</i>.
It defines options for the model generation process as well as for the simulation.<br>
The <i>Model Builder</i> currently only allows generating models from <b>flatted pruned entity structures (FPES)</b>.
</p>
<p>
Result of the model generation process is a <i>simulation model executable</i> (SME) or a <i>simulation model representative</i> (SMR) stored in the current directory.
The name of this SME or SMR is then passed to the execution unit, which performs a simulation run and returns the simulation results.
