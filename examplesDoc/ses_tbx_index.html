<h1>SES Examples Documentation</h1>

The SES Toolbox has been developed by the Research Group Computational Engineering and Automation (CEA) 
at Wismar University of Applied Sciences.<br>
<br>
It can be used for ontology based modeling of systems using the System Entity Structure (SES) approach.
A set of systems (e.g. system variants), called a family of systems, is specified with an SES. In conjunction with basic systems, which are organized in a Model Base (MB),
executable models for the MATLAB / Simulink environment can be generated.<BR>
<br>
The toolbox is based on a subset of the long term research of B.P. Zeigler, who comprehensively introduced the SES/MB approach with his book "Multifacetted Modeling and Discrete Event Simulation" in 1984.
Since that time the approach was continuously advanced by Zeigler and others. Accordingly, the toolbox also introduces new concepts, which increase the flexibility of modeling using the SES
ontology and extends the scope of application. Moreover, it provides additional features particularly useful for modeling and simulation in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. Of course, the toolbox is
also useable in combination with other proprietary MATLAB toolboxes, such as SimEvents or Simscape, or free available toolboxes, such as the Parallel Discrete Event System (PDEVS)
toolbox for MATLAB (MatlabDEVS Toolbox) also developed by the Research Group CEA.<br>
For more information about the SES theory and the toolbox itself look to the <a href="https://www.cea-wismar.de/tbx/SES_Tbx/sesToolboxMain.html" target="_blank">RG CEA SES tbx. web site</a>.


<p></p>
The examples can be seen as a pragmatic introduction tutorial. They demonstrate step by step basic SES modeling features.<br>
We advice to study the examples in their order, beginning with the <b><i>Basic</i> examples</b>.
