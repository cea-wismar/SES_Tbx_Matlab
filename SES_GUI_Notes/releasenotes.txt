Release_1.3 (2015/01/28)   
###########################################################################
MAJOR Release -- No compatibility with R_1.1 

Extension in Couplings
Output signals are now allowed to be connected with multiple input ports.
Bug in Flattening algorithm fixed!


Release_1.2 (2015/01/06)
###########################################################################
Insertion of new examples


Release_1.1 (2014/12/04)
###########################################################################
add some error messages when user tries to prune via Editor Menu bar.
Err: when Semantic Conditions are violated.
Err: When Numrep Value are not Integer greater than 0.
Resize Behaviour under Linux improved.
drawnow comments are added


Release_1.1 (2014/11/13)
###########################################################################
Warning message when node will be replaced or deleted.

Reloading SES Functions:
Update of an imported SES Function is now possible, when name of the 
Function is equal.

Close Model:
Close Model is now available over File-menubar. Closing the last opened 
Model leads to open a new Model.

Merging BUG: fixed!

Change Names:
Semantic Relations -> Semantic Conditions
Output Port -> From Port
Input Port -> To Port

Horizontal Slider for Function Preview added

Limitation: Slider disappears sometimes. You can get it back by clicking 
"Optimal Resolution" in file menu bar.

Displacement of NumRep Interval:
The Interval is now adjustable in the Coupling input mask of MAspects.

Function Syntax:
Syntax has changed. The generall usage of Functions in MATLAB is now 
possible. The previews Syntax is not 
supported anymore.
NOT ALLOWED: {@strcmp,'a',{'asd','a',var}}
ALLOWED:       strcmp('a',{'asd','a',var})

Displacement of Semantic Conditions:
Sem. Cond. are now adjustable in the SES Vars input mask.

New Resolution has been added -> 1920x1200

Selection Behaviour of Nodes:
Add Sibling Node -> The created node will be selected.
Replace node selection has been improved.

Color Information of Selection Constraints:
Color Infos are now saved in the SES. Change of SES Structure will lead to 
error messages to SES's that has 
been created with an older Release of the Editor.

Dependencies in SES Variables:
Now SES Variables can be depended from each other.

Bug in Selection Constraints:
Changing name of an inner node is now possible, when having Selection 
Constraints.


Release_1.1 (2014/10/10)
###########################################################################
Bug in pes-class- Evaluation of Functions in Attributes (evalFunInAtt):
Problem: Attribute Values doesn`t support vectors/Matrices, that are 
transfered by SES Variables.
Now it is possible. FIXED!

Parser Vector -> empty Vectors [] are allowed now


Release_1.1 (2014/10/06)
###########################################################################
Adding of different screen resolution for GUI:

The GUI has been implemented for default resolution 1600x900.
Additionally following fixed resolutions are supported: 1600x900, 1440x900,
1366x768, 1280x1024

The properties of each resolution are coded in a table in 
./data/resolution.xlsx

The table is loaded by the Editor automatically.
Using the menu (File -> Optimal Resolution) a method can be called that 
determines the optimal resolution depending on the current figure size.
Furthermore this method is automatically called when figure is maximized


Release_1.1 (2014/09/29)
###########################################################################
1st adaptation to Linux compatibility;
Reorganisation of files in subdirectories;

Automatic adding of SES toolbox paths to MATLAB search path:
1. Start MATLAB,
2. Change into the directory SES_Editor_1.1 
3. Start the editor from MATLAB prompt using ses_gui

Changes for 'MAspect' node attribute 'Number_of_Replications':
The user has to assign for this attribute at each MAspect node a 
SES Variable or SES Function.
It is possible to use the same SES Variable or SES Function on different 
MAspect nodes.
This feature extends the flexibility of MAspect nodes,
e.g. it is possible to define selection constraints beetwen MAspect nodes.

Fixing of some bugs;
